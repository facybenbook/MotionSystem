<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Inspired by the project https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/animation/locomotion-system-7135 this is an improved version with the same fundamentals as the original project. The code was almost all re-writen to support newer versions of Unity and also support Mecanim Animator.

A few key items:
* Improved performance
* Improved inspector
* Mecanim Animator
* No GC Allocations
* Less overhead using struct for data
* Motion analysis asset (can be shared and replaced at runtime)
* No need to setup skeleton again if adding or removing animations
* Motion analysis is a separated process from the character setup


Of course, the project is not perfect neither it will be the ideal solution for all cases, but it is an excellent starting point for making your personal adjustments according to the needs of your project. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue.

### Built With
This project was built using:
* [Unity 2019.4.1f1](https://unity.com/)
* [Visual Studio Community](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/pt-br/vs/community/)
* [Mixamo](https://www.mixamo.com/)


<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

Grab a copy of the project by downloading the zip file or forking the project.
The folder Project contains the source code and a small demo if you wish to try it first. 

### Prerequisites

* You must have Unity Engine installed on your computer. The project was built using Unity 2019.4 but I guess you could run it with Unity 2017+ (not previously tested)
* You also need to have a 3d model fully rigged and ready to animate with Mecanim.

### Installation

1. Copy the folder MotionSystem to your project
2. Place your 3d model anywhere in your scene and add the MotionController component to it

if you wish to inspect the animations add the MotionDebugger component to your character and assign the Vertex material.
